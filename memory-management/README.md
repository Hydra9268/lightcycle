# Memory Manager: Unified Solution for Memory Optimization and Heap Compaction

The `MemoryManager` class merges memory optimization and heap compaction into one robust solution for efficient memory management. This class helps monitor memory usage, trigger garbage collection, and schedule heap compaction during low-traffic periods, ensuring your application remains performant and stable across both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) environments.

## Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Memory Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage in real-time, periodically checking if memory exceeds the defined threshold.
2. **Chunking Large Datasets**: Processes large datasets in chunks to minimize memory usage.
3. **Garbage Collection Triggering**: In Node.js, triggers garbage collection if `--expose-gc` is enabled. In browsers, relies on the JavaScript engine for automatic garbage collection.
4. **Heap Compaction**: Compacts heap memory during low-traffic periods to reduce fragmentation and improve memory performance.
5. **Customizable Memory Thresholds**: Developers can define memory thresholds to trigger optimizations, providing flexibility for various use cases.
6. **Asynchronous Task Support**: Can monitor memory usage and trigger optimization while processing large datasets or handling asynchronous tasks.
7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly in both Node.js and browser environments, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Design Goals:
1. **Efficient Memory Usage**: Reduce memory bloat by optimizing memory usage during low-traffic periods.
2. **Seamless Garbage Collection**: Trigger garbage collection only when necessary to avoid impacting critical processes.
3. **Minimal Overhead**: Monitor memory with lightweight checks, minimizing impact on system performance.

## Code Example:
```js
// Chunking Large Datasets example
const memoryManager = new MemoryManager({
    memoryThreshold: 150 * 1024 * 1024, // 150MB
    checkInterval: 3000,
    lowTraffic: () => true
});

const chunkSize = 7500;
const subChunkSize = 1000;
const largeDataArray = Array.from({ length: 1000000 }, (_, i) => i);

const processSubChunks = async (chunk) => {
    for (let subIndex = 0; subIndex < chunk.length; subIndex += subChunkSize) {
        const subChunk = chunk.slice(subIndex, subIndex + subChunkSize);
        await new Promise((resolve) => {
            memoryManager.processLargeDataInChunks(subChunk, (processedChunk) => {
                console.log(`Processing sub-chunk of size ${processedChunk.length}`);
                console.log(`Memory usage during processing: ${memoryManager.getMemoryUsage()} MB`);
                resolve();
            });
        });
    }
};

for (let chunkIndex = 0; chunkIndex < largeDataArray.length; chunkIndex += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = largeDataArray.slice(chunkIndex, chunkIndex + chunkSize);
    await processSubChunks(chunk);
    console.log('All sub-chunks processed for chunk.');
}

console.log("All chunks processed successfully");

// Other examples
setTimeout(() => { memoryManager.stopMonitoring(); }, 120000); // Stop monitoring after 2 minutes
setTimeout(() => { memoryManager.simulateTrafficPeriod(false); }, 10000); // Simulate traffic period for testing
setTimeout(() => { memoryManager.simulateTrafficPeriod(true); }, 30000); // Simulate low-traffic period
```

## Benefits:
- **Real-Time Memory Monitoring**: Continuously checks memory usage, preventing memory bloat and performance degradation.
- **Efficient Memory Optimization**: Triggers garbage collection or heap compaction only during low-traffic periods, minimizing impact during high usage.
- **Cross-Platform Flexibility**: Works across server and client environments, making it adaptable for various use cases.
- **Handles Asynchronous and Synchronous Operations**: Supports efficient memory management even during long-running or asynchronous operations.

## Use Cases:
1. **Server-Side (Node.js) Applications**:
   - Ideal for long-running Node.js processes or microservices where memory usage needs to be managed effectively.
2. **Client-Side Web Applications**:
   - Helps control memory usage in single-page applications (SPAs) or complex UIs with large datasets.
3. **Real-Time Applications**:
   - In real-time apps with fluctuating traffic (e.g., chat apps or dashboards), the class can detect low-traffic periods and optimize memory usage accordingly.

## Conclusion:
The `MemoryManager` class provides a unified, efficient way to handle memory usage and heap compaction in both server-side and client-side JavaScript applications. By intelligently monitoring memory, detecting low-traffic periods, and triggering optimizations when needed, it ensures that your applications run smoothly even under heavy load, without sacrificing performance.
