### Abstracted Solution for Profiling and Learning Application Memory Patterns

The key idea is to design a library to monitor memory usage across **any** operation, whether processing large datasets, updating DOM elements, handling user interactions, or making network requests. The library should analyze these memory patterns over time, detect areas where memory usage becomes excessive, and recommend or apply optimizations.

### Design Goals:
1. **General Purpose Monitoring**: The library should be able to monitor any operation—DOM manipulations, network requests, async functions, etc.—and learn memory usage patterns.
2. **Adaptive Optimization**: The library should offer suggestions for optimizations or apply them automatically based on the learned patterns.
3. **Threshold-based Alerts**: It should trigger alerts when memory usage crosses predefined thresholds.
4. **Customizable Hooks**: Developers should be able to hook into specific stages to customize profiling behavior and receive detailed reports.
5. **Minimal Overhead**: The monitoring should be efficient and not impose a significant performance burden on the application.

### Key Features of the Abstracted Library:

1. **General-Purpose Profiling**:
   - The library can profile any operation—whether a DOM update, a network request, or a CPU-heavy task—by registering it with `registerOperation`.
   - This allows developers to profile memory usage for any application part.

2. **Learning Memory Patterns**:
   - The library monitors memory usage for each operation over time, and stores learned patterns. It computes average memory usage and identifies memory spikes.
   - Developers can review these learned patterns to optimize code where memory usage becomes excessive, or patterns indicate potential improvements.

3. **Custom Callbacks**:
   - Each operation can receive a callback that provides real-time memory usage information, allowing developers to react to memory issues as they occur.

4. **Memory Alerts**:
   - The library triggers a memory alert if memory usage crosses a specified threshold (default 150 MB). This can help developers spot memory-intensive areas of their code early.
   
5. **Historical Analysis**:
   - The library stores memory usage history and provides a method (`analyzeMemoryHistory`) to analyze this history later. This helps in long-term performance and memory optimization efforts.

6. **Adaptive Learning and Recommendations**:
   - By learning memory patterns over time, the library could eventually provide recommendations or even optimizations, such as reducing memory usage or triggering GC when certain patterns emerge.

### Benefits:

- **Flexibility**: The library is general enough for any operation—DOM updates, network requests, or data processing. This allows developers to profile and optimize any part of the application.
- **Memory Pattern Learning**: The library enables developers to learn how their applications use memory over time by analyzing and storing memory usage patterns, helping to spot inefficiencies.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Developers can monitor memory usage in real-time for specific operations, which is particularly useful in applications with unpredictable memory usage patterns.
- **Alerts for Memory Spikes**: The library proactively alerts developers when memory usage exceeds a threshold, helping them identify memory issues before they become problematic.

### Use Cases:

1. **DOM Updates**: The library profiles DOM manipulations, such as inserting or removing elements, and learns how memory is used over time. This is useful in applications with dynamic UIs, like dashboards or data-driven pages.
   
2. **Network Requests**: For heavy network requests or large payloads, the library monitors memory usage and flags memory consumption spikes, helping optimize network-intensive operations.

3. **Event-Driven Tasks**: In event-driven architectures (e.g., interactive UIs, chat apps), the library can monitor memory usage during user-triggered events, like clicks or form submissions, and provide insights for optimization.

### Code Examples:

```js
const { default: MemoryProfiler } = await import('./abstract-memory-profiling-and-learning.js');
const { default: DomElementManager } = await import('../dom-element-manager/dom-element-manager.js');

const memoryProfiler = new MemoryProfiler();
const domElementManager = new DomElementManager();

// Example usage: Profiling memory usage for different types of operations

// Profiling a DOM update
function profileDomUpdate() {
    const operationId = memoryProfiler.registerOperation('DOM Update', (memoryUsage) => {
        console.log(`Memory used during DOM Update: ${Math.round(memoryUsage / 1024 / 1024)} MB`);
    });

    // Simulate a DOM update operation
    setTimeout(() => {
        const gridDisplay = document.querySelector('.grid-display');
        const newDiv = document.createElement('div');
        newDiv.textContent = 'New Content';
        gridDisplay.appendChild(newDiv);

        memoryProfiler.completeOperation(operationId);
    }, 500);
}

// Profiling a network request
function profileNetworkRequest() {
    const operationId = memoryProfiler.registerOperation('Network Request', (memoryUsage) => {
        console.log(`Memory used during Network Request: ${Math.round(memoryUsage / 1024 / 1024)} MB`);
    });

    // Simulate a network request
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // Complete the operation
            memoryProfiler.completeOperation(operationId);

            const outputElement = document.getElementById('json-output');
            const postLimit = 25;

            // Create an array of post data objects from the data object, limiting to the post limit
            const posts = Object.keys(data).slice(0, postLimit).map(key => ({
                title: data[key].title,
                body: data[key].body
            }));

            // Use updateContainer function from the DomElementManager class to update the container with the post elements
            domElementManager.updateContainer(outputElement, posts, 'div', (postElement, post) => {
                debugger;
                // Check if the postElement has the necessary structure, or create it if not
                let titleElement = postElement.querySelector('h1');
                let bodyElement = postElement.querySelector('div.post-body');

                if (!titleElement) {
                    titleElement = domElementManager.getElement('h1');
                    postElement.appendChild(titleElement);
                }

                if (!bodyElement) {
                    bodyElement = domElementManager.getElement('div');
                    bodyElement.classList.add('post-body');
                    postElement.appendChild(bodyElement);
                }

                // Update the content of the recycled or new elements
                titleElement.textContent = post.title;
                bodyElement.textContent = post.body;

                // Add post-card class if it's not present
                postElement.classList.add('post-card');
            });

        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.error('Network request failed', err);
        });
}

profileDomUpdate();
profileNetworkRequest();
```
